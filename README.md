# Work
I'm currently working as an Engineering Manager at [Plenty of Fish](https://pof.com) / [Match Group](https://mtch.com/). I joined the POF brand at Match Group in January 2022.

I have a strong track record as a builder and leader of software development teams. My recent work includes Trust and Safety, Monetization, Payments, and Platform Services.

# Side Projects
I have worked on several side projects over the years. Some info about them is below.

## Kore Tools (2022-Current)
Towards the end of 2022 I solo-founded [Kore Tools](https://www.kore-tools.com/), a developer tools platform built to help make software development faster. I felt that there was a gap in some core technologies that developers need to build scalable, reliable solutions to real-world problems. 

I started with the basics: I am self-bootstrapping, in an indie hacker style, a product called [Kore Cache](https://blog.kore-tools.com/blog/20221108_AnnouncingKoreCache). Kore Cache is a distributed cache which you can setup and get started with in production in <5 minutes. My goal is to spread that ease of use and reliability to other areas of development in the future. I want people to be able to leverage core technologies in a few minutes without having to sell their souls, customer data or life savings to Amazon, Google or Facebook for the pleasure of doing so.

Kore Tools is being built in public. You can read the trials and tribulations on the [KT blog](https://blog.kore-tools.com) or on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/koretools).

This project uses a bunch of technologies in a microservice-style architecture. I'll blog more about it, but it's primarily built with C# and .Net 6, backed by a PostgreSQL data store, and TypeScript, NextJS and Tailwind for frontend work.

## OpenHouseTrader (2019-2020)
In 2019, my wife and I co-founded OpenHouseTrader. OHT was a SaaS marketplace intended to be used by real estate brokerages to swap open house appointments with other realtors at the same brokerage. Unfortunately, our timing couldn't have been worse and the COVID-19 pandemic started just before our closed beta began. We weren't sure how long the pandemic would last, so we cut our losses and moved on from OpenHouseTrader after 3 months of building.

This project was built with C#, .Net Core, Angular and Bootstrap.
